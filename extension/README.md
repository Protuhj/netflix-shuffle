A shuffle button for Netflix TV shows.

To operate, simply navigate to a show's page on Netflix and click the extension's button. A random episode will play. The extension will also work if you access a show by searching, or through the 'Shows You Might Like' feature Netflix has.

The extension will notify you if you are on an invalid page or a page for a show that hasn't been added. I am adding shows all the time. If there's a show you would like support for, send me a note and I'll add it in the next release.
